Objects in JavaScript

An object is an unordered list of primitive data types and sometimes reference data types.
 These are stored as a series of name-value pairs. e.g firstName: "Alex", lastName: "Herbert".
 Functions within objects are called Methods. 
 Create an object via object.Create() 

 3 WAYS OF CREATING AN OBJECT 
    Object Literal - ({})
    Object Constructor - (new Object())
    Function Constructor - (new FunctionName())

Object Literal

//initializing an object Literal
var companyInfo = {};

Object Constructor - new Object()

//initializing empty object
var companyInfo = new Object();

//assign properites to above object
companyInfo.name = "";
companyInfo.code = "";
companyInfo.city = "";
companyInfo.getCode = function();
{
    return this.code; //this. points to the piece of code you declare.
}

instanceof will confirm what type of object you are targeting
